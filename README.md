## 🧬 **What is StreetMug?**
**StreetMug** is a bridge between the street and the future.  
A platform for people living on the edge of the city grid —  
where a simple cup becomes a **digital identity, a tool, a voice**.

The goal is simple:

- give street people tools to **grow**,  
- give them a **digital presence**,  
- give them access to **crypto basics**,  
- and connect them with the upcoming **$ZIK token**  
- and the more more creative ecosystem on way...

### ✔ Basics of crypto

### ✔ SMUG Token  
A community token powering future StreetMug mechanics.

### ✔ StreetMug Box  
A space to share art, photos, music, and street creativity.

### ✔ Future integration with extra futures...

## 🌌 **The Philosophy**
StreetMug is not charity.  
It’s not pity.  
It’s not another “help app”.  

It’s **empowerment through technology**,  
**knowledge**,  
**identity**,  
and **community**.

Because the street sees everything —  
but nobody sees the street.
